    "# Changes to improve  \n",
    "1️⃣ NoisyCartPoleWrapper\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Correct Approach: Adds Gaussian noise to the action.  \n",
    "⚠ Issue:  \n",
    "\n",
    "The action in CartPole-v1 is discrete (0 or 1), but noisy_action becomes continuous due to np.random.normal().  \n",
    "Clipping (np.clip(noisy_action, 0, 1)) does not correctly map back to {0,1}.  \n",
    "Fix: Instead of directly adding noise to a discrete action, use probability flipping:  \n",
    "\n",
    "def step(self, action):  \n",
    "    if np.random.rand() < self.noise_std:  # With probability `noise_std`, flip action  \n",
    "        action = 1 - action  \n",
    "    return self.env.step(action)  \n",
    "👉 This ensures actions remain 0 or 1 while still introducing randomness.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2️⃣ WindyCartPoleWrapper\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Correct Approach: Applies wind as a force that changes over time.  \n",
    "⚠ Issue:  \n",
    "\n",
    "Modifying obs[1] (cart velocity) directly does not actually apply force to the environment; it only changes the observation.  \n",
    "The true physics of CartPole are managed internally, so directly changing obs[1] does not actually push the cart.  \n",
    "Fix:  \n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of modifying obs[1], add force inside the environment's physics using env.unwrapped.state.  \n",
    "def step(self, action):  \n",
    "    # Occasionally change wind force  \n",
    "    if np.random.rand() < self.wind_change_prob:  \n",
    "        self.wind_force = np.random.uniform(-self.wind_max, self.wind_max)\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Apply action  \n",
    "    obs, reward, terminated, truncated, info = self.env.step(action)\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Apply wind effect by modifying the environment’s internal state (not just observation)  \n",
    "    self.env.unwrapped.state[1] += self.wind_force  # Modify velocity directly in environment  \n",
    "\n",
    "    return obs, reward, terminated, truncated, info  \n",
    "👉 This properly simulates wind affecting the cart’s velocity.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3️⃣ DelayedActionCartPoleWrapper\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Correct Approach: Introduces an action delay using a queue.  \n",
    "⚠ Issue:  \n",
    "\n",
    "The queue (deque) is initialized with 0, meaning for the first few steps the agent always takes action 0 regardless of policy.  \n",
    "This biases the early learning by making the agent effectively ignore initial training steps.  \n",
    "Fix:  \n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of defaulting to 0, initialize with random past actions to avoid bias.  \n",
    "self.action_queue = deque(np.random.choice([0, 1], delay_steps), maxlen=delay_steps)  \n",
    "👉 This prevents early-action bias."
